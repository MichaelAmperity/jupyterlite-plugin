- rework as ipywidget data passing
 

// experience
- just 3 buttons (run, sql toggle on / off, delete)
- rerun with full set option if <500k rows, !download at top of sql to auto do that, download csv path
- default to wider display (2000px?)
- abort request when multiple queries, handle spamming
- help menu with links to all tools
- auto replace 'import library' with what is needed for the different tools with pip install and other append to the top

// to get code approved
- feature flag 'edit access', 'publish view only -- show 'ask for this document to be published' on main page
- stand up jupyter site like docsite
- clean code and squash commits
